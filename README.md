This project is a team effort using the MERN stack, integrating MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. MongoDB stores and manages data, while Express.js and Node.js handle backend logic, ensuring smooth communication with the React.js frontend. The collaboration focuses on building a scalable and interactive application with seamless data flow and user experience.
